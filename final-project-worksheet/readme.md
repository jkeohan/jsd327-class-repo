# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|May 1st| Project Description | Complete
|May 8th| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|May 15th| External API(s) Decision / Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|May 22nd| Minimal Viable Product | Incomplete
|May 29th| Styling / Bug Fixes | Incomplete


## Project Description

The Color Picker will load a well-formatted interface displaying an array of colors to interact with. When a color is selected, the following information is shown in a modal: the breakdown of the color conversions (CMYK, RGB, HEX) where the values will be displayed in a chart representing the amounts of the primary colors [(example)](https://www.colorhexa.com/), description of the color family, color history and cultural meanings, use in company branding, and where this color is used in famous works of art or photographs. This project would mostly focus around [The Color API](http://www.thecolorapi.com/). The selected color can be added to a swatch book for future reference, and then can be shared with a url with co-workers. 

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

1. Load colors onto the home page 
2. Select a color from the grid 
3. Bring up a model for the color chosen
4. Show the color name in the modal 
5. Show conversions of that color in different color codes 
6. Show a color meaning for the color family chosen
7. Save that color to a swatch 
8. Close the color modal
9. Add multiple colors onto a swatch


#### PostMVP 

10. Share that swatch URL
11. Signup and Login 
12. Save swatch to account

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous  phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
